## 1.2 Core Insight

> **"Detrás de cada pelotero dominicano en Grandes Ligas hay miles de galones de gasolina: los viajes a las academias, los torneos de pueblo, los padres que manejaron horas para que su hijo tuviera una oportunidad."**

## 1.3 Emotional Pillars

| Pillar | Expression | Visual Translation |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **SACRIFICE** | Silent, dignified, never complained | Fathers driving at dawn, worn hands on steering wheel |
| **HOPE** | Persistent, unshakeable, generational | Children's eyes looking toward horizon |
| **JOURNEY** | Physical and metaphorical | Roads, cars, distance, time passing |
| **PRIDE** | Contained until the moment of triumph | Tears held back, then released |
| **FAMILY** | The unit that makes dreams possible | Shared moments, rituals, connection |

## 1.4 Campaign Tagline

> **"Desde las canchas de tierra hasta las Grandes Ligas"**

## 1.5 Brand Tagline

> **"Cada satisfacción empieza con un impulso."**
> **IMPULSO DOMINICANO** — *El combustible que mueve lo nuestro.*

# 2. VISUAL IDENTITY

## 2.1 The Look: "Poetic Realism"

Our visual approach blends **documentary authenticity** with **cinematic poetry**. We capture real Dominican life but elevate it through light, composition, and timing.

```
DOCUMENTARY TRUTH + CINEMATIC BEAUTY = POETIC REALISM
```

### What This Means:

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Locations** | Real places, not sets—but chosen for visual potential |
| **People** | Authentic faces, not "commercial beautiful" |
| **Moments** | Observed, not staged—but perfectly captured |
| **Light** | Natural, enhanced—never artificial-looking |
| **Emotion** | Earned through story, not manipulated |

## 2.3 What We Are NOT

| AVOID | WHY |
|-------|-----|
| Overly polished/commercial | Feels fake, loses authenticity |
| Poverty porn | Disrespectful, exploitative |
| Generic "Latino" aesthetic | We are specifically Dominican |
| Sports highlight reel style | We're not ESPN, we're emotion |
| Melodramatic music video | Earned emotion, not manufactured |
| Dark/gritty realism | Hope is our currency |

# 3. CINEMATOGRAPHY

## 3.1 Camera Philosophy

> **"The camera is a family member. It doesn't observe from outside—it lives inside these moments."**

### Movement Principles

| Time Passage | Match cuts, visual rhymes |

## 3.2 Aspect Ratios

| Format | Ratio | Usage |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Hero Spots (90"/60")** | 2.39:1 (Cinemascope) | Theatrical, epic |
| **Standard Spots (60"/45")** | 2.39:1 or 1.85:1 | Cinematic |
| **Social Cutdowns** | 16:9, 9:16, 1:1 | Platform native |

## 3.3 Lens Language

## 3.4 Camera Movement Dictionary

## 3.5 Signature Shots

These shots should appear across multiple pieces for visual continuity:

through windshield, father's hands on wheel, child visible in

Connection through reflection.

# 5. CHARACTER BIBLE

## 5.1 Character Design Philosophy

> **"These are not actors playing roles. These are Dominican people living their lives. We just happen to be watching."**

### Authenticity Guidelines

| Cast faces with character and history | Cast conventionally "beautiful" models |
| Show imperfect teeth, skin, bodies | Airbrush away humanity |
| Let age show truthfully | Make elders look "distinguished" cliché |
| Reflect real Dominican diversity | Default to one skin tone |
| Allow natural expressions | Direct toward "commercial" reactions |

### EMMANUEL LUBEZKI (Primary Reference)
**Films**: The Tree of Life, The New World, The Revenant, Children of Men, Gravity

**Why He's Our North Star:**
Emmanuel "Chivo" Lubezki is THE cinematographer behind Terrence Malick's visual poetry. When we say "Malick style," we're really describing Lubezki's work. Three consecutive Academy Awards (Gravity, Birdman, The Revenant) cement him as the defining cinematographer of this era.

| **Backlight / Rim Light** | Subjects glowing against Dominican landscapes |
| **Practical Light Sources** | Car dashboards, window light, candles |
| **Magic Hour as Character** | Dawn and dusk ARE the visual signature |

**His Philosophy (Apply to Every Shot):**
> *"I try to use available light as much as possible. I want the light to feel real, to feel like it comes from a source that exists in the world."*

**Signature Lubezki Moments to Recreate:**

| Reference | Our Application |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Tree of Life sunrise sequences | Father and son departures at dawn |
| The Revenant forest light | Dominican mountain road journeys |
| Children of Men car interior | Dashboard POV driving scenes |

| **Underexposure with Detail** | Shadows that hold information, never crushed |
